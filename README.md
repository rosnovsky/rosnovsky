## Hi there 👋

Art's here. I'm a software engineer from Arlington, WA (~50 miles north of Seattle). I work full-time on helping [@Auth0̸](https://github.com/auth0) customers onboard faster, secure their apps and solve identity.


- 😄 My pronouns are he/him, I'm also comfortable with they/them.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Auth0̸ DSE Sample Apps](https://github.com/DSE-Side-Projects/auth0-example-apps), a catalog of apps to help other Auth0 developer support engineers troubleshoot faster
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social justice resourses (bail funds, justice reform, racial justice, econimic justice, immigrant support, etc) 
- 💬 Ask me about identity management, securing access to your apps, role-based access management, Auth0 rules and hooks, 
- 📫 How to reach me: rosnovsky@pm.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can fly a single-engine airplane.
