## Hi there 👋

Art's here. I'm a software engineer from Arlington, WA (~50 miles north of Seattle). I work full-time on helping [@Auth0̸](https://github.com/auth0) customers onboard faster, secure their apps, and solve identity.


- 😄 My pronouns are he/him, I'm also comfortable with they/them.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on rebuilding [Rosnovsky.us](https://rosnovsky.us) from scratch, and maintaining [Sanity Tags Autocomplete Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanity-plugin-autocomplete-tags) (1200+ daily downloads).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social justice resourses (bail funds, justice reform, racial justice, econimic justice, immigrant support, etc) 
- 💬 Ask me about identity management, securing access to your apps, role-based access management, Auth0 rules and hooks, 
- 📫 How to reach me: artem@rosnovsky.us
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can fly a single-engine airplane.
