## Hi there 👋

Art's here. I'm a software engineer from Mill Creek, WA (~20 miles north of Seattle). I work full-time on providing support to developers who use [@Auth0](https://github.com/auth0) to secure their apps and solve identity.


- 😄 My pronouns are he/him, I'm also comfortable with they/them.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Auth0 DSE Sample Apps](https://github.com/DSE-Side-Projects/auth0-example-apps), a catalog of apps to help other Auth0 developer support engineers troubleshoot faster
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social justice resourses (bail funds, justice reform, racial justice, econimic justice, immigrant support, etc) 
- 💬 Ask me about identity management, securing access to your apps, role-based access management, Auth0 rules and hooks, 
- 📫 How to reach me: rosnovsky@hey.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can fly a single-engine airplane.

### What else?

I ❤️ [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [ZEIT](https://vercel.com) (make me call it Vercel, go ahead, I dare you!) and all things [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). React, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), GraphQL, serverless functions and all this good stuff.
